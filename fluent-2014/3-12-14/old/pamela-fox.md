## Pamela Fox (Khan Academy)

- works for Khan academy
- teaches using JS and processing.js
- visual programming

- first challenge stats
  - why do younger students not complete the first challenge?
  - 13 year olds ~82% completion (89% max)
  - require spacial reasoning

- first logic challenge
  - bouncing ball demo
  - much fewer young students (~50 8 year olds)
  - concepts got harder?
  - conditionals and comparators
  - temporal and spacial reasoning
  - 13 year olds ~73% completion rate

- a reasonable conclusion
  - 13 year olds can learn JS and processingJS
  - start with simple programming , games?
  - can use js to learn other subjects (lit, phyics, etc)
