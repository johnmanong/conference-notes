## BB Recruiting
- no swag
- no one was at booth (8-9am)
- physically seperate from the rest of the sponsors...not in a good way
- what make bloomberg attractive for a web developer?
- back of program print ad
  - terminal marketing
  - no mention of an actual project
  - being a js conference, this is kinda weird

## General Notes
- talks are starting to feel like pitches
- lunch was not planned well...
